## Happy Pi Day

In honor of [Pi Day](http://www.piday.org/), I 
thought I would write a little Ruby script to 
generate pi to a few decimal places.

A quick trip to the [Wikipedia page for pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Computation_in_the_computer_age)
turned up many formulas for computing pi. I took
one of the easy ones and set about writing some
code.

Ruby doesn't have a built in method for computing
the factorial. I found a nice, functional example
at the [Rosetta Code wiki](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Factorial#Ruby).

Putting that all together, I ended up with this:

    def fact(n)
      (1..n).reduce(1, :*)
    end

    sum = 0.0

    (0..8).each do |n|
      a = fact(2 * n) ** 3.0
      b = 42.0 * n + 5.0
      c = fact(n) ** 6.0
      d = 16.0 ** (3.0 * n + 1.0)

      sum += (a * b) / (c * d)

      puts 1.0 / sum
    end

Note that I'm only iterating 8 times. On my PC, that
gives pi out to 15 decimal places which is all of the
precision available in a floating point number.
