# Rails on Rackspace Cloud

This is my recipe for starting up a new
Rackspace Cloud Server and getting it 
set up for hosting Ruby on Rails applications.

If you don't already have an account with
Rackspace, I encourge you to go over to 
[http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/)
and check them out.

I prefer Ubuntu Linux, so let's start with
that.

## Starting a New Server

First, sign in to your Cloud Control Panel,
then click Hosting, Cloud Servers.

Click the Add Server button, scroll down to
Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat), then click
the Select button.

Now type in a server name and select how much
RAM you'll need, then click the Create Server
button.

After a short wait, your new server should be 
ready to go.  You will receive an e-mail with
your new server's IP address and root password.

Connect to the IP Address with SSH, log in
as root with the password provided, and lets
get started.

## Initial Login

The first thing you should do at this point is
change the root password, then add a new user
to use for the rest of the installation.

    passwd

Type in your new root password twice.

    adduser testapp

Type in the information for your new user.

    usermod -a -G sudo testapp

Add the new user to the sudo group so you can
execute commands as root.

Now that we have a new account to use, we need
to deny the root user access via ssh.  This
will stop people trying to brute-force our root 
password.

    vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find the line that contains "PermitRootLogin" and
change the value from "yes" to "no".  Restart the
ssh server when you're done.

    /etc/init.d/ssh restart

We have set up a new user account with sudo access
and denied root login via ssh, so let's log out
for now.

    logout

## New User Login

Now reconnect with your new user account and let's
make sure all of our software is up to date.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

This should be really fast.  Rackspace's internet
connection puts mine to shame.

## Installing RVM

Next, we'll install git so we can install rvm.

    sudo apt-get install git

Now copy and paste the command below to install rvm:

    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

Once this finishes, you will see a lot of instructions for
setting up rvm as well as a nice "Thank you" from Wayne.

As instructed, edit your .bashrc file...

    vim ~/.bashrc

and add this line at the very bottom:

    [[ -s "/home/testapp/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "/home/testapp/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

Finally "source" your .bashrc file so the change will take effect.

    source ~/.bashrc

## Installing Dependencies

Now we'll install the rest of the packages we need to
build ruby.  RVM can provide us a list of needed software.

    rvm notes

Look at the line starting with "For Ruby" to get a list of
dependencies.

    sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 \
                         libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev \
                         libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev \
                         sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev \
                         ncurses-dev

Again, this shouldn't take long.

# Installing Ruby

We're finally ready to install Ruby.

    rvm install 1.9.2

We have Ruby 1.9.2 now, let's use it.

    rvm use 1.9.2
